                    The most important factor in improving code is improving the programmers themselves. People want to hire the perhaps-mythical <em>10x programmer</em>,
                    but this is not something that is easily measured in day-to-day life. But this ideology does stand true. You'd rather have a coding SEAL than a group
                    of people whose sole purpose in life was to memorize all the solutions to every single LeetCode question.<br>
                    With that being said, we have to be wary of having swagger without any actual ability. It pays to know you skills and have some pride in them, but
                    one has to be careful not to descend into the land of hubris.
                    Your attitude is just as important as your code in the scheme of being a good Software Engineer. You must <b>want</b> to be a better programmer,
                    it doesn't just happen on its own. To do well at someting, you have to care about that thing. You cannot be a <strong>selfish programmer</strong>.
                    Practice makes perfect. When you want to improve, you need to follow the 3 Fs:</p>

                        <li>Failure</li>

                    Students may be concerned about the high volume of image macros <span class=definition>("memes")</span> contained within the previous slideshow.
                    Rest assured, this was a one-off occurrence, and students should not be alarmed at the appearance of any other image macros, as these will appear alone.
